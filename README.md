# Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

### Steps Taken:
1. Opened Chrome Mobile → Settings → Privacy & Security → Ads Privacy → Ad Topics.
2. Found active ad topics:
   - Computer Education
   - Computers & Electronics
   - Distance Learning
3. Removed unwanted ad topics using the ❌ option.
4. Turned OFF Ad Topics to stop Chrome from tracking browsing history for ads.
5. Since Chrome Mobile has no extensions, Ads Privacy settings were used instead.

### What I Learned:
- Desktop browsers use extensions which may track users and show ads.
- On mobile, Ad Privacy settings behave like built-in “extensions” that control tracking.
- Blocking ad topics improves privacy and prevents personalized ad tracking.
- Awareness: Even without extensions, browser privacy must be checked regularly.

### Outcome:
- No suspicious extensions found (Chrome Mobile does not support them).
- Ads Privacy topics reviewed and unnecessary ones removed.
- Stronger awareness of how both extensions and ad privacy settings affect security.
